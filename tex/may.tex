\section{Build sparse matrix with Eigen efficiently} \index{Build sparse matrix with Eigen efficiently}

When I build a sparse matrix with Eigen, I come across a problem that it is quite slow. The problem is that
when you \textit{insert} elements one by one, each time Eigen needs to reallocate space for the matrix and copy
the data, which is reason that it can be slow. 

The solution is to first record the row, column index as well as value of non-zero entries with \textit{triplets},
and then build the sparse matrix with the function \textit{setFromTriplets}.
